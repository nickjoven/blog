# Google foo == bar ?

    Oh, snap! A wild coding challenge appeared!

Incidentally, the way it showed up makes kind of makes me [look like a clown](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-joven_google-activity-7021986275616247809-hLeT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), but this thing is too *slick* to not talk about.

## What is this thing?

The internet alleges that this is a semi-secret Google hiring tool, but, there are equally many reports indicating it *doesn't lead to interviews anymore*, so I'm just going to play around with it while I have access.

Here's the deal: your browser prompts you to solve a challenge from Google. If you accept, you're taken to [foobar.withgoogle.com](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/), which (after confirming your Google login) provides you with an in-browser *linux* terminal! No further instructions, but you're informed that a *help* command exists.

With some prodding around the virtual file system, your next logical step is to input the *request* command, which will give you a challenge. This is similar to LeetCode and HackerRank, but the fact that the UI is a terminal is pretty sweet. If you can't tell by this blog design, I like simple things. And it doesn't get much simpler than a terminal and an IDE.

Here's the screen after finishing 1 of 5 challenge.

In case it's a faux pas to leak the questions, I won't paste the text or directly quote anything. From what I understand, the challenges get increasingly more difficult, so, it makes sense that first one felt like a warm up. I was given two arrays as an input and had to perform some comparison of the elements in as efficient a way as possible. My solution ended up needing *O(n + k) time* at worst and *O(n) space*--but I wonder if there was a better solution.

Oh, and the compatible languages are Python and Java. I was lucky enough to run into my friend Nic, who gave me a syntax rundown in 30 minutes!

This is a fun little adventure, so I might do a follow up post. I've cracked open part 2, and, since it's a time-sensitive application, will have more to say soon!
